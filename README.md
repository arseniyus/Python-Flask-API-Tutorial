# Python-Flask-API-Tutorial

Hi! Welcome to my Python Flask API Tutorial Workshop

### Why

- Why Python?

Python is a very popular and common programming language. It is on par in popularity with JavaScript.
Python is used in everything from web/software development, automation, machine learning, data analysis and data visualisation.

Why not just stick with JavaScript, it does a lot of that just as well?
It is good to be tech agnostic. It encourages flexibility of thinking, confidence, and fosters problem-solving.
Also, broadening your toolset as a bootcamper increases your chances of being hired. The more you learn the more you earn!

- Why Flask?
  Flask is a Python web framework that allows yout to buiuld lightweight (loads quickly) web apps very quickly and easily.

* It is known as a microframework, as it keeps the crux of the app simple and scaleable.

- But it doesn't include things like ORM (Object Relational Manager) or form validation, by itself.

* It is however extendable. Meaning, you can extend its functionality through various extensiuons. E.g you can choose to add validation.
* Flask is built on top of the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit, which handles req, res objects and utility functions.
* Jinja2 is Flasks' template enginne for rendering dynamic web pages. It essentially acts like Python's "React". It also allows you to pass Python variabls into HTML templates. (Similar to JSX).

P.S. Don't worry about remembering all of that. This is just for your understanding and awareness.

- Easy to use. Flask has a very small learning curve. Perfect for beginners.
- Local Development: you can "local host" with it. :)

### What

Ticket 1)

- Install Flask and set up a virtual environment for your project.
- Create a file app.py.

Ticket 2)

- write some code to define your API endpoints and logic.

Ticket 3) Run the server and make the first API call using a tool like Postman or curl.

Ticket 4) Implement different HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for your API.

Ticket 5) Create a class to represent your data model and set up a SQLite database connection.
